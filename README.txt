# StarClusterPlot
StarClusterPlot is a Python package published and maintained by Teerat Chanromyen that helps visualize a star cluster's structure and its Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram with real, calculated color. It is specifically designed to work with data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey or any dataset that contains g, r, right ascension, and declination values.
The package includes three functions: ClusterVis(), HRDiagram(), and Temp_to_RGB().
